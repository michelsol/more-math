Let $$\mathcal{H}$$ be the unit hypercube of dimension 4 with a vertex at $$(x, y, z, w)$$ for each
choice of $$x, y, z, w \in$$ $$\{0,1\}$$. (Note that $$\mathcal{H}$$ has $$2^{4}=16$$ vertices.)
A bug starts at the vertex $$(0,0,0,0)$$.
In how many ways can the bug move to $$(1,1,1,1)$$ (the opposite corner of $$\mathcal{H})$$ by
taking exactly 4 steps along the edges of $$\mathcal{H}$$ ?
